# Diablo III Character Planner

### Information

This repository does not include most server-side scripts (related to importing characters and saving/loading information), but other than that everything should work. Also, 3D viewer data is not included to save space.

If you want to try running it locally, set up a webserver (i.e. XAMPP/Apache) and point it to the trunk directory. I added www.d3local.com -> 127.0.0.1 to my hosts file, but it should work if you refer to it as localhost as well. You can also place it in a subdirectory of your webroot - in this case, change the RewriteBase in .htaccess files.

In order to test an existing profile from the main website, open `http://www.d3planner.com/load?id=<profile-id>` and copy the text into `php/input.txt`. Now if you open `http://localhost/0`, it should load that profile.
